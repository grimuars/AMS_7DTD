		<!-- NOTES:
			<Noise ID="1" noise="7" time="3" muffled_when_crouched="0.5"/>
			- ID: I just made that one up so it would be easier to use search&massReplace
			- (deprecated)volume: volume of the sound which can trigger AI wake
			- noise: the cumulative volume value that goes into the player's stealth meter.
			- time: game time seconds until noise is removed
			- muffled_when_crouched: scales noise range when entity is crouched
			- heat_map_strength: how much to add to heat map (once 100 is hit, horde scout is spawned)
			- heat_map_time: how long this heat "event" will stick around and add to the local heat map strength. (60 equals about 100 seconds)
			<LocalCrouchVolumeScale name="0-1"/> - changes the sound volume played when you are crouched
			<CrouchNoiseScale name="0-1"/> - changes the noise volume used when you are crouched to signal AI
			<NoiseScale name="0-1"/> - changes the amount of noise this sound makes in general for AI
			<MaxVoices value="1-inf"/> - maximum simultanious SoundDataNodes playing at once
			<MaxRepeatRate name="0-inf"/> - this SoundDataNode will not be played faster than the repeat rate (can be used to reduce "audio soup")
			<distantfadestart name="0-inf"/> 	<distantfadeend name="0-inf"/> - Distant audio clips will begin to play at distantfadestart in meters from the listener.  The volume of the regular audio clip will reduce to zero as distance approuches distantfadeend; and the distant audio clip will play with increasing volume up intil distantfadeend for full volume.

			<LowestPitch name="0.5"/> -?
