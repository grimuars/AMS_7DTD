***** FPS Power and Light R1 *****


NOTE:  BEFORE INSTALLING -->ANY<--  MOD, MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVED GAMES!!!

Installs just like almost every mod. Does not require a new game.

This mod should work server side just fine!

After extracting the downloaded 7z file contents just place the entire folder
"FPS Power and Light R1" into your mods folder and you should be ready to go.

The old Mods folder was located here:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods 

The newer Mods folder (recommended) is located here:
C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\Mods

You can also put   %AppData%\7DaysToDie\Mods  in the address bar in Windows Explorer
or in the Search Box on your desktop and it will take you to the correct location.

This mod allows you to craft almost all of the POI lights and use a power source 
to make them light up. When you craft one it will show in your inventory as a 
FPS Powered Light and you can use the radial menu to select the one you want.
There are over 100 different lights in the menu counting the color variations!

There are also recipes incuded to let you craft a Wire Tool, Generator Bank, Solar Bank,
Solar Cells, Battery Banks and Batteries. 

The Battery Banks and Solar Banks will produce more power than the "vanilla" ones.
The Generator Banks will produce more power but may use a bit more fuel doing it.


I hope you enjoy the mod!
