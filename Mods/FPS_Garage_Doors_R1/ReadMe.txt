***** FPS Garage Doors R1 *****

NOTE:  BEFORE INSTALLING -->ANY<--  MOD, MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVED GAMES!!!

Installs just like almost every mod. Does not require a new game.

This mod should work server side just fine!

After extracting the downloaded 7z file contents just place the entire folder
"FPS Garage Doors R1" into your mods folder and you should be ready to go.

The old Mods folder was located here:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods 

The newer Mods folder (recommended) is located here:
C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\Mods

You can also put   %AppData%\7DaysToDie\Mods  in the address bar in Windows Explorer
or in the Search Box on your desktop and it will take you to the correct location.


This mod allows you to craft a FPS Garage Door Variant Helper to allow you to make
most of the existing garage doors and gates. It also includes vault doors and hatches.
You can destroy an existing door and it will appear in your inventory as a 
FPS Garage Door Variant Helper. You can then choose which door or gate you would
like it to be with the radial menu! 

A recipe is included for the FPS Garage Door Variant Helper based on the 3x3 rollup door.

Just a reminder... there are powered and non-powered doors in this group. Powered doors
will require power and non-powered ones do not.


I hope you enjoy the mod!
