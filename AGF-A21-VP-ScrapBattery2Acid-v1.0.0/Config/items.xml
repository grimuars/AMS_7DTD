<!--BATTERIES SCRAP INTO ACID
	Feature: 	When you scrap a battery, you get 1 Acid.
	
	Default: 	When you scap a battery, you get some lead.
				You can smelt it in forge for some lead as well.
	
	XML's: 		items, materials, recipes, localization
	
	Why: 		In my opinion, lead has plenty of ways of obtaining without the battery.
				Scrapping it for acid, everyone I talk to says, "it makes sense."
	
	Delete?: 	Safe to delete with zero consequences.
	
	Code:		Modified carBattery material to support what it scraps into.
				Modified carBattery weight to impact the amount of acid you get from scrapping.
				Modified  resourceAcid weight to impact the amount of acid you get from scrapping a battery-->
